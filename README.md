# Weather Forecast Application

The Weather Forecast Application provides users with current location weather information, a five-day forecast, and the ability to search for weather details in other cities. The application is built using native components and integrates with the OpenWeatherMap Open Source API for fetching weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, and icons.
